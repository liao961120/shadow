All credits go to <https://github.com/umd-mith/webvtt-player>. This is a
slightly modified version to allow choosing audio files through a dropdown menu.


## Contributions Welcomed

You can create a pull request to upload the files you want (beware of copyright
restrictions though). Just place the `.mp3` files and the `.vtt` transcripts in
the `data/` directory by following the existing directory structure. Then, run
`ls data > playlist.txt` or manually add the directory name in `playlist.txt`.
Be sure to also include a reference to the audio source. After the pull request
is reviewed and merged, you will be able to select your audio file at
<https://yongfu.name/shadow>.
